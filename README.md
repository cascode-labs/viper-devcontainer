# Viper IC Design Devcontainers

A collection of devcontainers for designing integrated circuits.

These devcontainers provide a pre-configured and reproductible EDA design
environment.  They allow a designer to open an IC design project and
immediately start , editing and simulating it.

## Advantages

- pre-configured: No need to setup a long-list of design software
- Reproducible: Each designer has the same design environment
- full-featured: Includes tools for both analog and digital design

## Opening a project in VS Code

The recommended method of opening a Viper project in a devcontainer is by
using the official support in Visual Studio (VS) Code.
